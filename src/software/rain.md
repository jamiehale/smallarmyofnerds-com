I am an ardent user of the _[Getting Things Done][1]_ method. Over the years, my system has been implemented in PalmOS To-Do lists, in hand-written notebooks, in a _[Hipster PDA][2]_, and in several custom and third-party software packages.

Because of my particular tweaks to stock GTD, and because I'm amazingly picky about software not getting in the way of its users, I have written several custom applications (and suites) to keep me happy. All of them were useful to me at the time. None of them have progressed to the point where I would present them to the public - until recently.

The latest and greatest implementation of _Rain_ has been designed with multi-platform sync in mind from the outset, and is nearing usefulness. It consists of a git-like repository-with-sandbox and a command-line interface. The core is implemented in Ruby because Ruby is awesome. A web front-end will be added once the core and CLI are complete. An Android client will follow.

When there is something worth seeing, it will be on [GitHub][3] (what's there now is proof-of-concept work - pay no attention).
