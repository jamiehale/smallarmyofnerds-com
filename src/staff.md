## Jamie Hale
__(Principal)__

![Jamie Hale][1]

Jamie has been programming computers since he was 9 years old. He has an Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science specializing in Software Engineering. He has been a professional software engineer since 1995. He is fluent in most modern programming languages, and even a few not-so-modern ones. He is a strong advocate for the software craftsmanship movement and cares passionately about writing high quality code.

He skis, he'll play any musical instrument you leave lying around, and when he thinks nobody's looking, he still pulls out the old Dungeons and Dragons books.
